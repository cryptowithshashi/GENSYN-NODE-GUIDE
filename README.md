# GENSYN AI RL SWARM NODE GUIDE

RL Swarm is an open source system for peer-to-peer reinforcement learning over the internet. Running a swarm node allows you to train your personal model against the swarm intelligence. Each swarm performs RL reasoning as a group, with a gossiping system (Hivemind) for collaborative improvement between models. You can also connect your node to the Gensyn Testnet, to receive an on-chain identity that tracks your progress over time.

RL Swarm is fully open and permissionless, meaning you can run it on a basic consumer laptop at home or on a powerful GPU in the cloud. You can also experiment with different models to see which ones perform best.


## System Requirements

| Hardware | Requirements     |
| :-------- | :------- | 
| CPU | arm64 or amd64 architecture |
| RAM | Atleast 16 GM RAM |
| PYTHON VERSION | Version 3.10 or higher |
| GPU (OPTIONAL) | Supported models include RTX 3090, RTX 4090, A100, H100 |


  

## üîß Install Dependencies

Update system packages
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Install core tools: Python, pip, venv, curl, screen, git, lsof

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip curl screen git lsof
```

Install Node.js 20.x and npm

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -  
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

Add Yarn repository and install Yarn

```bash
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -  
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list  
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y yarn
```

Check versions (optional, verify installs)

```bash
python3 --version  
node -v  
npm -v  
yarn -v
```

## Clone and Setup RL-Swarm

Clone RL-Swarm repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gensyn-ai/rl-swarm.git
```

Start a screen session for RL-Swarm

```bash
screen -S gensyn
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd rl-swarm
```

Create and activate Python virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv  
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install frontend dependencies (for modal-login)

```bash
cd modal-login  
yarn install  
yarn upgrade  
yarn add next@latest viem@latest
```

Update repository

```bash
cd rl-swarm  
git switch main  
git reset --hard  
git clean -fd  
git pull origin main
```

Run the node

```bash
cd ..  
./run_rl_swarm.sh
```

Answer the Prompts
When prompted, respond exactly like this:

- Would you like to connect to the Testnet? ‚Üí Y

- Which swarm would you like to join (Math (A) or Math Hard (B))? ‚Üí A

- How many parameters (in billions)? ‚Üí 0.5 (or as per your choice)

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: After this, it will start building the server. This takes a long time.

But here do some magic we leave this terminal as it is and we will open a new terminal of the same vps and execute some commands

## üî• Additional Setup Steps

First, ensure nano is installed (if you get "command not found" error):

```bash
sudo apt install nano
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd rl-swarm
```

head to the config file and make some critical changes:

```bash
nano hivemind_exp/configs/mac/grpo-qwen-2.5-0.5b-deepseek-r1.yaml
```

Inside the file, use your keyboard arrows to navigate and edit these values:

```bash
torch_dtype: float32
bf16: false
tf32: false
gradient_checkpointing: false
per_device_train_batch_size: 1
```

‚úÖ After editing, press:

Ctrl + X ‚Üí Exit

Y ‚Üí Yes

Enter ‚Üí Save

## Make Magic: Bypass Slow Web Login

Open a new terminal tab on your VPS. In this new tab
Install LocalTunnel:

```bash
npm install -g localtunnel
```

Start LocalTunnel:

```bash
lt --port 3000
```

Copy the generated localhost URL and open it in your browser.
Sign up, complete the login process, and you're done!

After login, you can close this tab and go back to the main terminal (the one building the server).


## Final Prompts (Back in Main Terminal)

Once the server finishes downloading and setting up, you‚Äôll see more prompts:

Would you like to push models you train in the RL swarm to the Hugging Face Hub? ‚Üí N

W&B Account integration ‚Üí 3 (Don't visualize my results)

‚ö†Ô∏è Copy your Node Name and Peer ID. Save them somewhere safe‚Äîthese are used to check your node status later.






### Manage Node & Screen Session

Detach from screen (keep node running)
Press `Ctrl + A`, then `D`

Re-attach to screen

```bash
screen -r gensyn
```

### Save `swarm.pem` file for future logins

Copy file from VPS to local machine:

```bash
scp USERNAME@YOUR_IP:~/rl-swarm/swarm.pem ~/swarm.pem
```

## Check Node Status

After setup, check your node status using the official telegram bot:

```bash
@gensynImpek_bot
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

- What is swarm.pem?
‚Üí It‚Äôs your key file for authenticating and managing your node. Keep it safe!

- Can I run this on Mac?
‚Üí No. This guide is for Linux/WSL only.

- How do I check my node‚Äôs logs?
‚Üí Re-attach to the screen session using `screen -r gensyn.`

By following these steps, you should have a running Gensyn Testnet Node on your VPS. Happy swarming!
